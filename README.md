## 🆕 NEW: Video-Edit Skill (with Interactive Transcript Editor)

A complete captioned-video pipeline that **pauses for human transcript approval** before the
long final render — the support mechanism that makes captions perfect (especially Hebrew).
Transcribes any video with `faster-whisper` (defaults to `large-v3`), applies a configurable
corrections dictionary, opens an **interactive browser editor** with video preview, per-line
inline editing, dictionary apply, find/replace and **optional in-browser LLM suggestions via
WebLLM** (Qwen2.5-3B / Llama-3.2-3B over WebGPU — runs entirely offline once cached). On
approval, redistributes word timings and generates a HyperFrames composition with
liquid-glass caption pills, drifting blob background, liquid morph wipes, and optional
behind-subject text via background removal. Supports English, Hebrew and any
Whisper-supported language.

🔗 **[View the Video-Edit Skill →](skills/video-edit/SKILL.md)**

**What's inside:**
- `transcribe.py` — faster-whisper CPU/CUDA with safe fallback
- `make_review.py` + `apply_review.py` — emit & ingest a `transcript_review.txt` round-trip
- `transcript-editor/index.html` — self-contained webapp (RTL-aware, autosaves to localStorage)
- `gen_body.py` — generator for editorial + matrix liquid-glass caption sub-composition
- `host-template.html` + `liquid-blobs.html` + EN/HE parallax-outro templates
- `corrections-hebrew.md` — curated dictionary of common Hebrew Whisper mishears

---

## 🆕 NEW: Video-to-Landing-Page Skill

Drop a video, get a cinematic **scroll-driven landing page** — Apple-style sticky hero where
scrolling progresses the visible frame through the video. Extracts evenly-spaced frames via
ffmpeg, builds a self-contained `index.html` with a `requestAnimationFrame`-driven scroll
listener, and includes headline / sections / CTA below. Respects the `yuv-design` typography
(Anton + Inter for English, Rubik + Assistant for Hebrew) and pink/yellow/bone palette.

🔗 **[View the Video-to-Landing-Page Skill →](skills/video-to-landing-page/SKILL.md)**

**One command from video to deployable page:**

```bash
python skills/video-to-landing-page/references/extract-frames.py demo.mp4 ./landing-demo --build-html
```

Then customise `__HEADLINE__`, `__TAGLINE__`, `__CTA_TEXT__` in the generated `index.html`
and drop the folder on Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages.

## 🚀 NEW: Yuv-Viral-Video Skill

**Just added!** The complete signature-style video editor that turns raw selfie or screen-share footage into a viral short-form video the way YUV.AI ships them — Apple-style liquid-glass cards with real backdrop blur, dark-mode polish, MrBeast-paced cuts, video-title karaoke captions, content-relevant motion graphics, no fake content, **never covering the speaker's face**, always rendering BOTH 9:16 and 16:9, always saving with `_V<N>` backup suffix. Hebrew is rendered in Rubik Black (with proper RTL via `python-bidi`), English in Anton uppercase. Encodes every painful lesson from real edits as a hard rule the next render automatically respects.

🔗 **[View the Yuv-Viral-Video Skill →](skills/yuv-viral-video/SKILL.md)**

**What it does:**
- Apple-style frosted glass cards: rounded corners + `gblur sigma=24` backdrop + `alphamerge` masks so the blur stops cleanly at the rounded shape (no rectangular leak past the corners)
- Auto-routes the layout per archetype: screen-share footage shows the screen content (top 2/3) with rounded speaker PIP at bottom 1/3; full-frame selfie shows the speaker prominently with cards in the safe top-banner zone (face never covered)
- Per-segment dynamic motion (push-in / pull-out / snap-in / dolly / shake) baked into the extract chain with subtle MrBeast-style amounts
- Real animated diagrams: bar chart (uses actual category names from transcript, never fake numbers), flow diagram with glowing brand-color nodes connected by animated dashed arrows
- Word-by-word video-title karaoke: scale-pop entrance with `\fscx150\fscy150\t(0,140,\fscx100\fscy100)`, accent words get yellow + rotation jitter, English brand tokens auto-route to Anton uppercase
- Bottom key-moment glass strips that summarise the current beat in 1-4 words (Hebrew right + English left + yellow accent stripe)
- ElevenLabs SFX kit (impact, bass_drop, whoosh, riser, ding, glitch, typing) mixed at the right output times via `adelay`
- Two-pass loudnorm to -14 LUFS / -1 dBTP / LRA 11 (TikTok / Reels / YouTube standard)
- **Versioning**: every render writes a NEW `final_*_V<N>.mp4` — previous versions are never overwritten
- **Truth contract**: every word on every card is auditable against the actual transcript. No "$$$" placeholders, no "100% הבנה" if the speaker didn't say it, no "לינק בביו" if no link was promised

## 🆕 NEW: Meta Ads Skill

**Just added!** A battle-tested skill for pulling, analyzing, and managing Meta ad performance (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Click-to-WhatsApp, Threads) via the Marketing API. No guesswork, no generic dashboards — the scripts auto-discover your accounts, decode status codes and currency units, handle rate limits and async insights jobs, and guard write actions behind explicit confirmations.

🔗 **[View the Meta Ads Skill →](skills/meta-ads/SKILL.md)**

**What it does:**
- Pulls ad-level, ad-set-level, campaign-level, and account-level insights with full breakdowns (platform, placement, age, gender, country, device)
- Auto-discovers every ad account your token can see, ranked by last-30-day spend — so you never paste the wrong `act_` ID
- Handles both auth paths out of the box: System User tokens (never expire, BM-owned accounts) and long-lived user tokens (60-day, sees personal Instagram-boost accounts)
- Ships a token-exchange script for the short→60-day swap — no more fumbling through Graph Explorer docs
- Creative fatigue detection, anomaly detection vs. prior period, CTWA-aware analysis playbooks
- Write actions (pause, budget update, duplicate) gated behind explicit confirmation with impact summaries and rollback patterns
- Baked-in troubleshooting for every failure mode we hit the hard way: sandbox proxy blocks, 37-month data wall, DELETED-status error 1815001, minor-unit currency bugs, IG boosts invisible to SU tokens, and more

## 🆕 NEW: Google Workspace CLI Skill

**Just added!** A comprehensive skill that teaches AI agents to use the `gws` CLI — one command-line tool for **all** of Google Workspace: Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Chat, Tasks, Admin, Meet, Forms, Keep, and more. Your agent can now manage your entire Google Workspace without custom tooling.

🔗 **[View the Google Workspace CLI Skill →](skills/google-workspace-cli/SKILL.md)**

**What it does:**
- Enables AI agents to interact with every Google Workspace API via `gws` CLI commands
- Covers Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Chat, Tasks, Meet, Forms, Admin, Keep, Apps Script, and more
- Includes 100+ ready-to-use command examples with real JSON payloads
- MCP server integration for Claude Desktop, VS Code, Gemini CLI, and other MCP clients
- Multiple auth workflows: interactive, headless/CI, service accounts, and multi-account support
- Built on Google's Discovery Service — automatically picks up new API endpoints

## 📚 How Agent Skills Work (Step-by-Step for Beginners)

### Step 1: Understanding the File Structure

Each skill is a simple folder with a `SKILL.md` file inside:

```
your-project/
├── .github/skills/          # GitHub Copilot project skills location
│   └── my-skill-name/
│       ├── SKILL.md         # Main skill file (required)
│       ├── script.js        # Optional: supporting scripts
│       └── examples.md      # Optional: more examples
├── .claude/skills/          # Claude Code project skills location
│   └── my-skill-name/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── ~/.copilot/skills/       # Personal skills (available across all projects)
    └── my-skill-name/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Step 2: Understanding SKILL.md Format

Every `SKILL.md` file has two parts:

**YAML Frontmatter** (metadata):
```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name           # Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
description: What this skill  # When should the agent use this skill?
license: MIT                  # Optional: license information
---
```

**Markdown Body** (instructions):
The rest of the file contains instructions and examples for the AI agent.

### Step 3: A Real Example

Here's what a simple `SKILL.md` looks like:

```markdown
---
name: github-actions-debugging
description: Guide for debugging failing GitHub Actions workflows. Use this when asked to debug CI/CD failures or workflow issues.
---

# Debugging GitHub Actions Workflows

When debugging a failing workflow:

1. **Check the job logs** - Look for error messages and stack traces
2. **Review recent changes** - What changed since the last successful run?
3. **Test locally** - Reproduce the issue in your local environment
4. **Fix and validate** - Make changes and verify they work

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Workflow fails with "Command not found"
**Solution**: Install the required tool in your workflow step

### Issue: Permission denied when running scripts
**Solution**: Add `chmod +x script.sh` before running the script
```

### Step 4: Agent Discovers and Uses Your Skill

When you ask your AI agent to do something:

```
"Debug why our GitHub Actions workflow is failing"
```

The agent will:
1. ✅ **Recognize** that you're asking about GitHub Actions
2. ✅ **Find** the `github-actions-debugging` skill in your project
3. ✅ **Load** the `SKILL.md` file into its context
4. ✅ **Follow** the instructions to help you debug

### Step 5: Supported Locations

**Project Skills** (specific to one repository):
- `your-repo/.github/skills/` — For GitHub Copilot
- `your-repo/.claude/skills/` — For Claude Code

**Personal Skills** (available across all projects on your machine):
- `~/.copilot/skills/` — For GitHub Copilot (Copilot CLI and VS Code)
- `~/.claude/skills/` — For Claude Code

**Organization/Enterprise Skills** (coming soon):
- Enterprise-level skills support is in development

4. **Start building** - Windsurf will use these rules contextually

</details>

---

### 🎓 What Happens After Setup?

Once you've set up your skills:

1. **Agent Detects Skills**: Your AI agent scans the skill directories
2. **Agent Reads SKILL.md**: It reads the name and description from frontmatter
3. **Agent Activates on Relevance**: When you ask a question matching the description, the agent loads the skill
4. **Agent Follows Instructions**: Your agent now has the context to help you accurately

### 💡 Example: Using a Vercel Skill

**You have this SKILL.md**:
```yaml
---
name: vercel-deployment
description: Deploying applications to Vercel. Use this when asked about deploying, hosting, or managing Vercel projects.
---
```

**You ask your agent**:
> "Help me deploy my React app to Vercel"

**Agent automatically**:
- ✅ Finds `vercel-deployment` skill
- ✅ Loads SKILL.md into context
- ✅ Follows the deployment instructions
- ✅ Helps you deploy successfully!

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|:--------|:---------|
| Agent not using skill | Restart your agent, or make sure folder path is correct |
| Skill file not found | Verify `SKILL.md` is in the right folder and named exactly "SKILL.md" |
| Agent using wrong skill | Make sure skill descriptions are descriptive enough to match your request |

---

## 💻 Usage (Advanced)

---

## 📐 Skill Format

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description with trigger keywords
---

# Skill Title

Quick start and core patterns...
```

### 🎯 Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Concise is key** | Only include what the AI doesn't already know |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Start with quick start, then advanced patterns |
| **Concrete examples** | Working code over abstract descriptions |
| **Trigger keywords** | Include words that activate the skill |
