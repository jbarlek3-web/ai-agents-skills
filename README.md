## ⚡ Install the full creative stack in one command

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoodini/ai-agents-skills/master/install.sh | bash
```

Installs **15 skills** as one package: **yuv-pilot** (top-of-pyramid orchestrator) · **yuv-design-system** (brand) · **yuv-decks** (cinematic presentations) · **yuv-viral-video** (short-form) · **video-edit** · **video-to-landing-page** · **parallax-landing-page** · **hyperframes** + 4 companions · **nano-banana-pro** (AI images) · **mermaid-diagrams**. Plus ffmpeg / Node / Python / faster-whisper / hyperframes CLI / Python venvs / cross-tool symlinks to ~/.copilot/skills + ~/.agents/skills. Works on macOS, Linux, Windows (Git Bash/WSL).

After install, restart your agent and just type what you want:

```
"make a deck about <topic> for <audience>"
"build a stunning parallax landing page from this video: <path>"
"edit this video into a viral short: <path>"
```

The right skill auto-fires. Projects save to **`~/Documents/yuv-projects/{decks,landings,videos}/<slug>/`** so they're always findable.

> 🌐 **Live examples:** [yuv.ai](https://yuv.ai) · [effects.yuv.ai](https://effects.yuv.ai) (HyperFrames effects catalog) · [examples/parasites/](examples/parasites/) (three parallax landings: GitHub Desktop, Marcus the lion, Hope the cheetah)

## 🪜 The YUV.AI skills pyramid

The YUV.AI creative stack is a **three-tier pyramid**. You don't have to remember which skill does what — say what you want, the orchestrator routes.

### How to invoke

| Say | What fires |
|---|---|
| `"build me a deck about <topic> for <audience>"` | `yuv-decks` (lead) + `yuv-design-system` in **Decks mode** + `open-slide` scaffolding |
| `"build a landing page for me / my brand"` | `yuv-design-system` in **Neon mode** + `gsap` for motion |
| `"turn this video into a landing page"` *(5–15s clip)* | `parallax-landing-page` — scroll-scrub cinematic landing |
| `"turn this video into a landing page"` *(longer, with sections)* | `video-to-landing-page` — Apple-style sticky-hero |
| `"edit this video / add captions"` | `video-edit` — transcript-review-before-render workflow |
| `"make it viral / YUV.AI short"` | `yuv-viral-video` — opinionated MrBeast-paced pipeline |
| `"launch my new course / cross-channel campaign"` | `yuv-pilot` — orchestrates a build order across multiple skills |
| `"what should I build for my brand"` *(strategic, no specific deliverable)* | `yuv-pilot` — surfaces options |
| `"build me a snake game"` *(no YUV.AI signal)* | **Whole pyramid stays out** — picks whatever palette fits |
| `"build me a YUV.AI snake game"` *(explicit brand signal)* | `yuv-design-system` in **Neon mode** + Three.js or Canvas |

### Three palette modes (only when applied)

| Mode | When | Palette |
|---|---|---|
| **Neon** *(default for YUV.AI web/app/game/dashboard/social)* | Anything that's not a slide deck | Hot pink `#FF1464` + neon cyan `#00E5FF` + white or rich black |
| **Decks** *(Fly High)* | Presentations, slides, keynotes only | Purple `#5E17EB` + yellow `#FFEC00` + grey `#F1F2F2` |
| **Warm Editorial** | Hope, Marcus, bigcats.ai, practical.yuv.ai | Pink + yellow + bone |

The pyramid auto-applies **only** when YUV.AI brand context is signaled (`my brand`, `for me`, `YUV.AI`, etc.). Generic requests stay outside the system — Claude / Copilot / Cursor pick whatever fits the project.

## 🆕 NEW: yuv-design-system — single source of truth for visuals

Yuval Avidani's canonical design system, now public. **Replaces** the prior `yuv-design` skill (which only covered the Warm Editorial pink/yellow/bone family). Encodes:

- **Two palette modes** — **Fly High** (purple `#5E17EB` + yellow `#FFEC00` + grey, the default for keynotes / dashboards / dev-facing UIs) and **Warm Editorial** (pink + yellow + bone, only for the Hope / bigcats / practical.yuv.ai brand family)
- **Mandatory typography** — Anton + Inter for English, Rubik + Assistant for Hebrew, letter-spacing 0 by default
- **Signature components** — `PurpleBar`, `YellowUnderline`, `FlightHUD`, `CompassDial`, `CounterUp`, `HeroBg`
- **Brand assets bundled** — 4 phoenix logos + studio portrait, with a 4-step asset-retrieval fallback chain for any machine
- **Canonical link set + bio** — auto-included on any footer / about / credits block
- **Lessons-learned reference** — 15 hardened production patterns (bilingual toggle, mobile hamburger threshold, Anton letter-spacing rules, yellow-span `line-height ≥ 1.0`, IntersectionObserver for GSAP catalogs, GH Pages cert nudge, …)
- **Pre-flight checklist** — 14 mandatory checks before any visual ships

🔗 **[View yuv-design-system →](skills/yuv-design-system/SKILL.md)**

Pairs with `yuv-decks` (cinematic presentation builder), `yuv-viral-video` (short-form video), and `hyperframes` (capture web → MP4). Project brand wins when explicitly specified; otherwise this skill fills the vacuum.

---

## 🆕 NEW: yuv-decks — opinionated cinematic deck builder

Builds open-slide presentation decks in Yuval Avidani's signature style: 4-act narrative arc (Boarding → Ascent → Cruise → Descent), Yuval voice (plain-language, no jargon, ≤8–12 word bullets, define every name), the flight-themed `JourneyBar` unifying every slide, reusable `UseCase` / `CaseStudy` / `LessonsGrid` templates, and an automatic orchestration of nano-banana cinematic hero images + Hyperframes video moments + Mermaid technical diagrams.

Inherits all palette/typography/components from `yuv-design-system` and locks the **Decks mode** (Fly High purple/yellow/grey — the dedicated palette for slides). For talks whose central metaphor IS literal flight, opt into the `cinematic-flight` mode (sky-blue + hot pink) — same arc and JourneyBar, different palette. Never falls through to Neon (web/app palette).

Reference implementation: <https://github.com/hoodini/build-agents-that-ship> (the NICE pre-hackathon "Build Agents That Ship" deck, May 2026).

## 🆕 NEW: Parallax Landing Page Skill

Turn any short video (5–15s) into a **cinematic scroll-driven landing page** where the
user's scroll gesture *scrubs the frames in place* — the page itself never scrolls. A single
locked viewport with five dramatic text scenes that crossfade in/out as the frame index
advances, an Anton + Caveat typography contract, off-white #f5f1ea (never pure white), a
vignette + film-grain overlay, a loader that preloads every frame, and a final scene that
holds the CTAs (no separate end section). Built on the proven `parasites/` reference repo
(GitHub Desktop / Marcus the white lion / Hope the cheetah landings).

🔗 **[View the Parallax Landing Page Skill →](skills/parallax-landing-page/SKILL.md)**

**What's inside:**
- `scripts/extract_frames.py` — ffprobe + ffmpeg `-q:v 2` extraction with auto-computed `scrollBudget` (≈26 px per frame, clamped to `[2500, 8000]`)
- `assets/parallax.js` — virtual-scroll controller: wheel/touch/keyboard intercepted, document never moves, RAF-driven lerp (0.22) for buttery frame scrubbing
- `assets/style.css` — locked-body landing page CSS (`body.scrub-page`), 5-scene grid, vignette + grain, Anton/Caveat/Inter font stack
- `assets/landing-page-template.html` — full template with `{{placeholders}}` for slug, scenes, CTAs
- `assets/hub-template.html` — 3-up showcase grid template for multi-landing projects
- `references/copy-guide.md` — the five-beat arc (Hook → Origin → Stakes → Moment → Resolution) with three real cinematic examples
- `references/showcase-integration.md` — exact edits to grow an existing hub (card + nav + chain CTA)

**One-shot:** point the script at a video, capture the JSON, fill in the template, serve with `python -m http.server`.

```bash
python skills/parallax-landing-page/scripts/extract_frames.py demo.mp4 ./out/demo
```

🎬 **See it live:** the three landing pages built with this skill ship in
[`examples/parasites/`](examples/parasites/) — GitHub Desktop, Marcus the white lion,
and Hope the cheetah. After cloning:

```bash
cd examples/parasites && python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/
```

> Note: distinct from `video-to-landing-page` (which uses an evenly-spaced
> scroll-listener approach). This skill is the "Apple AirPods Pro" variant — every frame,
> locked body, dramatic typography, narrative beats.

---

## 🆕 NEW: Video-Edit Skill (with Interactive Transcript Editor)

A complete captioned-video pipeline that **pauses for human transcript approval** before the
long final render — the support mechanism that makes captions perfect (especially Hebrew).
Transcribes any video with `faster-whisper` (defaults to `large-v3`), applies a configurable
corrections dictionary, opens an **interactive browser editor** with video preview, per-line
inline editing, dictionary apply, find/replace and **optional in-browser LLM suggestions via
WebLLM** (Qwen2.5-3B / Llama-3.2-3B over WebGPU — runs entirely offline once cached). On
approval, redistributes word timings and generates a HyperFrames composition with
liquid-glass caption pills, drifting blob background, liquid morph wipes, and optional
behind-subject text via background removal. Supports English, Hebrew and any
Whisper-supported language.

🔗 **[View the Video-Edit Skill →](skills/video-edit/SKILL.md)**

**What's inside:**
- `transcribe.py` — faster-whisper CPU/CUDA with safe fallback
- `make_review.py` + `apply_review.py` — emit & ingest a `transcript_review.txt` round-trip
- `transcript-editor/index.html` — self-contained webapp (RTL-aware, autosaves to localStorage)
- `gen_body.py` — generator for editorial + matrix liquid-glass caption sub-composition
- `host-template.html` + `liquid-blobs.html` + EN/HE parallax-outro templates
- `corrections-hebrew.md` — curated dictionary of common Hebrew Whisper mishears

---

## 🆕 NEW: Video-to-Landing-Page Skill

Drop a video, get a cinematic **scroll-driven landing page** — Apple-style sticky hero where
scrolling progresses the visible frame through the video. Extracts evenly-spaced frames via
ffmpeg, builds a self-contained `index.html` with a `requestAnimationFrame`-driven scroll
listener, and includes headline / sections / CTA below. Respects the `yuv-design-system` typography
(Anton + Inter for English, Rubik + Assistant for Hebrew) and Fly High purple palette by default.

🔗 **[View the Video-to-Landing-Page Skill →](skills/video-to-landing-page/SKILL.md)**

**One command from video to deployable page:**

```bash
python skills/video-to-landing-page/references/extract-frames.py demo.mp4 ./landing-demo --build-html
```

Then customise `__HEADLINE__`, `__TAGLINE__`, `__CTA_TEXT__` in the generated `index.html`
and drop the folder on Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages.

---

## 🚀 NEW: Yuv-Viral-Video Skill

**Just added!** The complete signature-style video editor that turns raw selfie or screen-share footage into a viral short-form video the way YUV.AI ships them — Apple-style liquid-glass cards with real backdrop blur, dark-mode polish, MrBeast-paced cuts, video-title karaoke captions, content-relevant motion graphics, no fake content, **never covering the speaker's face**, always rendering BOTH 9:16 and 16:9, always saving with `_V<N>` backup suffix. Hebrew is rendered in Rubik Black (with proper RTL via `python-bidi`), English in Anton uppercase. Encodes every painful lesson from real edits as a hard rule the next render automatically respects.

🔗 **[View the Yuv-Viral-Video Skill →](skills/yuv-viral-video/SKILL.md)**

**What it does:**
- Apple-style frosted glass cards: rounded corners + `gblur sigma=24` backdrop + `alphamerge` masks so the blur stops cleanly at the rounded shape (no rectangular leak past the corners)
- Auto-routes the layout per archetype: screen-share footage shows the screen content (top 2/3) with rounded speaker PIP at bottom 1/3; full-frame selfie shows the speaker prominently with cards in the safe top-banner zone (face never covered)
- Per-segment dynamic motion (push-in / pull-out / snap-in / dolly / shake) baked into the extract chain with subtle MrBeast-style amounts
- Real animated diagrams: bar chart (uses actual category names from transcript, never fake numbers), flow diagram with glowing brand-color nodes connected by animated dashed arrows
- Word-by-word video-title karaoke: scale-pop entrance with `\fscx150\fscy150\t(0,140,\fscx100\fscy100)`, accent words get yellow + rotation jitter, English brand tokens auto-route to Anton uppercase
- Bottom key-moment glass strips that summarise the current beat in 1-4 words (Hebrew right + English left + yellow accent stripe)
- ElevenLabs SFX kit (impact, bass_drop, whoosh, riser, ding, glitch, typing) mixed at the right output times via `adelay`
- Two-pass loudnorm to -14 LUFS / -1 dBTP / LRA 11 (TikTok / Reels / YouTube standard)
- **Versioning**: every render writes a NEW `final_*_V<N>.mp4` — previous versions are never overwritten
- **Truth contract**: every word on every card is auditable against the actual transcript. No "$$$" placeholders, no "100% הבנה" if the speaker didn't say it, no "לינק בביו" if no link was promised

---

## 🆕 NEW: Meta Ads Skill

**Just added!** A battle-tested skill for pulling, analyzing, and managing Meta ad performance (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Click-to-WhatsApp, Threads) via the Marketing API. No guesswork, no generic dashboards — the scripts auto-discover your accounts, decode status codes and currency units, handle rate limits and async insights jobs, and guard write actions behind explicit confirmations.

🔗 **[View the Meta Ads Skill →](skills/meta-ads/SKILL.md)**

**What it does:**
- Pulls ad-level, ad-set-level, campaign-level, and account-level insights with full breakdowns (platform, placement, age, gender, country, device)
- Auto-discovers every ad account your token can see, ranked by last-30-day spend — so you never paste the wrong `act_` ID
- Handles both auth paths out of the box: System User tokens (never expire, BM-owned accounts) and long-lived user tokens (60-day, sees personal Instagram-boost accounts)
- Ships a token-exchange script for the short→60-day swap — no more fumbling through Graph Explorer docs
- Creative fatigue detection, anomaly detection vs. prior period, CTWA-aware analysis playbooks
- Write actions (pause, budget update, duplicate) gated behind explicit confirmation with impact summaries and rollback patterns
- Baked-in troubleshooting for every failure mode we hit the hard way: sandbox proxy blocks, 37-month data wall, DELETED-status error 1815001, minor-unit currency bugs, IG boosts invisible to SU tokens, and more

---

## 🆕 NEW: Google Workspace CLI Skill

**Just added!** A comprehensive skill that teaches AI agents to use the `gws` CLI — one command-line tool for **all** of Google Workspace: Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Chat, Tasks, Admin, Meet, Forms, Keep, and more. Your agent can now manage your entire Google Workspace without custom tooling.

🔗 **[View the Google Workspace CLI Skill →](skills/google-workspace-cli/SKILL.md)**

**What it does:**
- Enables AI agents to interact with every Google Workspace API via `gws` CLI commands
- Covers Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Chat, Tasks, Meet, Forms, Admin, Keep, Apps Script, and more
- Includes 100+ ready-to-use command examples with real JSON payloads
- MCP server integration for Claude Desktop, VS Code, Gemini CLI, and other MCP clients
- Multiple auth workflows: interactive, headless/CI, service accounts, and multi-account support
- Built on Google's Discovery Service — automatically picks up new API endpoints

---

## 🧠 Honest Agent Skill

---

## 📚 How Agent Skills Work (Step-by-Step for Beginners)

### Step 1: Understanding the File Structure

Each skill is a simple folder with a `SKILL.md` file inside:

```
your-project/
├── .github/skills/          # GitHub Copilot project skills location
│   └── my-skill-name/
│       ├── SKILL.md         # Main skill file (required)
│       ├── script.js        # Optional: supporting scripts
│       └── examples.md      # Optional: more examples
├── .claude/skills/          # Claude Code project skills location
│   └── my-skill-name/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── ~/.copilot/skills/       # Personal skills (available across all projects)
    └── my-skill-name/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Step 2: Understanding SKILL.md Format

Every `SKILL.md` file has two parts:

**YAML Frontmatter** (metadata):
```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name           # Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
description: What this skill  # When should the agent use this skill?
license: MIT                  # Optional: license information
---
```

**Markdown Body** (instructions):
The rest of the file contains instructions and examples for the AI agent.

### Step 3: A Real Example

Here's what a simple `SKILL.md` looks like:

```markdown
---
name: github-actions-debugging
description: Guide for debugging failing GitHub Actions workflows. Use this when asked to debug CI/CD failures or workflow issues.
---

# Debugging GitHub Actions Workflows

When debugging a failing workflow:

1. **Check the job logs** - Look for error messages and stack traces
2. **Review recent changes** - What changed since the last successful run?
3. **Test locally** - Reproduce the issue in your local environment
4. **Fix and validate** - Make changes and verify they work

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Workflow fails with "Command not found"
**Solution**: Install the required tool in your workflow step

### Issue: Permission denied when running scripts
**Solution**: Add `chmod +x script.sh` before running the script
```

### Step 4: Agent Discovers and Uses Your Skill

When you ask your AI agent to do something:

```
"Debug why our GitHub Actions workflow is failing"
```

The agent will:
1. ✅ **Recognize** that you're asking about GitHub Actions
2. ✅ **Find** the `github-actions-debugging` skill in your project
3. ✅ **Load** the `SKILL.md` file into its context
4. ✅ **Follow** the instructions to help you debug

### Step 5: Supported Locations

**Project Skills** (specific to one repository):
- `your-repo/.github/skills/` — For GitHub Copilot
- `your-repo/.claude/skills/` — For Claude Code

**Personal Skills** (available across all projects on your machine):

## 💻 Setup Guide: Using Skills in Your Agent (For Beginners)

This guide walks you through setting up Agent Skills in your favorite coding agent, step by step.

### 🎯 Prerequisites

Before you start, you need:
- A coding agent installed (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf)
- A project folder on your computer
- Basic familiarity with command line or your agent's UI

### 📍 Step-by-Step Setup

#### **Option 1: GitHub Copilot** (Most Popular)

<details>
<summary><strong>🟢 Setup GitHub Copilot with Skills</strong></summary>

**For Project Skills** (specific to one repository):

1. **In your project folder**, create the skills directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/skills
   ```

2. **Copy the skills you want** from this repository:
   ```bash
   # Copy a single skill
   cp -r skills/vercel .github/skills/
   
   # Or copy all skills
   cp -r skills/* .github/skills/
   ```

3. **Or manually create a skill**:
   ```
   your-project/
   └── .github/
       └── skills/
           └── my-custom-skill/
               └── SKILL.md
   ```

4. **Open your project in VS Code** and start using Copilot Agent
5. **Ask Copilot a question** related to your skill, and it will automatically load it!

**For Personal Skills** (available across all your projects):

1. **Find your home directory** (`~` or `C:\Users\YourUsername`)

2. **Create personal skills folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills
   ```

3. **Copy skills there**:
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/vercel ~/.copilot/skills/
   ```

4. **Now all your projects** can use these skills automatically!

**Verify it's working:**
- Open Copilot Agent
- Ask about something covered in your skill (e.g., "How do I deploy to Vercel?")
- Copilot will use the skill to help you

</details>

---

#### **Option 2: Claude Code**

<details>
<summary><strong>🟣 Setup Claude Code with Skills</strong></summary>

**For Project Skills**:

1. **In your project folder**, create the skills directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/skills
   ```

2. **Copy the skills you want**:
   ```bash
   # Single skill
   cp -r skills/langchain .claude/skills/
   
   # All skills
   cp -r skills/* .claude/skills/
   ```

3. **Open your project in Claude Code**
4. **Chat with Claude** about tasks covered in your skills - it will automatically use them!

**For Personal Skills** (available everywhere):

1. **Create personal skills folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
   ```

2. **Copy skills there**:
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/aws-agentcore ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

**Verify it's working:**
- Open Claude Code in your project
- Ask about something in your skill
- Claude will reference and use the skill

</details>

---

#### **Option 3: Cursor**

<details>
<summary><strong>🔵 Setup Cursor with Skills</strong></summary>

**For Project Rules**:

1. **In your project folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .cursor/rules
   ```

2. **Copy SKILL.md files** (rename them as rules):
   ```bash
   # Copy a skill as a rule file
   cp skills/figma/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/figma.md
   
   # Or copy multiple
   cp skills/*/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/
   ```

3. **In Cursor Settings**, configure which rules to use:
   - Settings → Rules → Add project rules
   - Point to `.cursor/rules/` folder

4. **Start using Cursor** - it will apply these rules to your context automatically

</details>

---

#### **Option 4: Windsurf**

<details>
<summary><strong>🟡 Setup Windsurf with Skills</strong></summary>

**For Project Rules**:

1. **In your project folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .windsurf/rules
   ```

2. **Copy skills as rules**:
   ```bash
   # Copy specific skills
   cp skills/vercel/SKILL.md .windsurf/rules/vercel.md
   
   # Or copy all skills
   cp skills/*/SKILL.md .windsurf/rules/
   ```

3. **Windsurf automatically** discovers rules in `.windsurf/rules/`
4. **Start building** - Windsurf will use these rules contextually

</details>

---

### 🎓 What Happens After Setup?

Once you've set up your skills:

1. **Agent Detects Skills**: Your AI agent scans the skill directories
2. **Agent Reads SKILL.md**: It reads the name and description from frontmatter
3. **Agent Activates on Relevance**: When you ask a question matching the description, the agent loads the skill
4. **Agent Follows Instructions**: Your agent now has the context to help you accurately

### 💡 Example: Using a Vercel Skill

**You have this SKILL.md**:
```yaml
---
name: vercel-deployment
description: Deploying applications to Vercel. Use this when asked about deploying, hosting, or managing Vercel projects.
---
```

**You ask your agent**:
> "Help me deploy my React app to Vercel"

**Agent automatically**:
- ✅ Finds `vercel-deployment` skill
- ✅ Loads SKILL.md into context
- ✅ Follows the deployment instructions
- ✅ Helps you deploy successfully!

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|:--------|:---------|
| Agent not using skill | Restart your agent, or make sure folder path is correct |
| Skill file not found | Verify `SKILL.md` is in the right folder and named exactly "SKILL.md" |
| Agent using wrong skill | Make sure skill descriptions are descriptive enough to match your request |

---

## 💻 Usage (Advanced)

---

## 📐 Skill Format

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description with trigger keywords
---

# Skill Title

Quick start and core patterns...
```

### 🎯 Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Concise is key** | Only include what the AI doesn't already know |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Start with quick start, then advanced patterns |
| **Concrete examples** | Working code over abstract descriptions |
| **Trigger keywords** | Include words that activate the skill |
